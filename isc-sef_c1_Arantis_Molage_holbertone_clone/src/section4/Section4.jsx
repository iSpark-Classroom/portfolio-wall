                    Project- based learning is a proven alternative learning methodology to
                    the traditional teacher-led lecture and educational memorization method.

                    Rather than teaching a lot of theory and having you occasionally apply a fraction of your knowledge on a class project, we do the opposite.
                    We give you increasingly difficult programming challenges to solve with minimal initial directions on how to solve them
                    </p>
                    <p className='s4paragraph3'>
                        Through learning by doing and learning how to rapidly adopt new skills and methodologies, you are better 
                        prepared to succeed in this ever evolving industry.You are trained,
                    challenged, and tested on today's technologies, but the learning 
                            skills you develop here will prepare you to adapt to and learn the technologies and the coding languages of tomorrow
